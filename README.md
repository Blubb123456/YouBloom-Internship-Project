# YouBloom-Internship-Project
In this project I have it to where the first thing you see is the Task Create Form. The Task Name is a text field, likewise with the task description. The status buttons are radio buttons labeled Pending and Complete. The Task Name and radio button fields are required. If you press the Create Button with those blank, it will tell you. Once the task is created, the fields are emptied and you can see the task below. It list the creation date, the name, the description (if applicable) and the status of the task. To edit, you press the Edit Button, which changes it to look like the Task Create form. If you press the Update and Save Button, the task would change. To delete the task, there is a Delete Task Button on the task and if you press it, it will wait for a confirmation. 

My assumptions were using HTML with PHP. I wasn't sure if I needed to use HTML or not, so it is all together in the same file. Just like there is some regular CSS and Javascript for some of the visuals and the confirmation message. I had struggled implementing Bootstrap, even with what was implemented. 

To run, I have it all as index.php and you can put it in visual studio code, and go to the test and debug tab, press that button and select the first option that shows up. I don't know if you wanted me to do it in XAMPP or something. I tried to but for some reason it refused to work, so.
